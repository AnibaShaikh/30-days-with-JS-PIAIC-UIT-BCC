Animations, Transitions and 3D Transforms

This demo shows some more interesting content using 3D transforms, animations and transitions. Note that you can still select the text on the the elements, even while they are rotating. Transforms elements remain fully interactive.

Click Toggle Shape to switch between nested cubes and one big ring. Note how the planes move smoothly to their new locations, even while the whole shape is rotating. You can even interrupt this transition by clicking again, and they move back smoothly.

Toggle the Backfaces Visible checkbox to turn backfaces on and off using -webkit-backface-visibility
